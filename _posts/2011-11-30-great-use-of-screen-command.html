<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Edit: This post was relevant when I was yet to discover the very amazing <a href="https://tmux.github.io/" target="_blank">tmux</a>.For me, <b>screen</b> seems like a distant memory now.<a href="https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator" target="_blank">tmuxinator</a> FTW!<br/><br/>I am getting used to the <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/grp/cd/soft/epics/extensions/iocConsole/screen.1.html" target="_blank">screen</a> command for my Linux development environment and I find it to be a great tool for detaching and reattaching sessions - but that's just scratching the surface from what I see on the net. As there are many useful posts out there explaining why screen is something that you've been missing if you are working via putty, I will let them do the talking. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.rackaid.com/resources/linux-screen-tutorial-and-how-to/" target="_blank">Introduction</a><br /><br /><a href="http://magazine.redhat.com/2007/09/27/a-guide-to-gnu-screen/" target="_blank">A redhat magazine post</a><br /><br />I am a newbie to screen and this is all that I have been doing:<br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Open multiple putty sessions via Putty connection manager</li><li>Foreach tabbed session I do a: <b>$ screen -S session_name</b></li><li>Code</li><li>While leaving for the day, disconnect all sessions - I don't "exit"</li><li>When I want to come back again - I open the tabs once again and reattach to previous session - I normally name my sessions "tab1", "tab2", etc. so reattaching is equivalent to:<b> $screen -d -r tab1</b><br /></li></ol>All this is good enough. I had just one rant while using screen - I did not know how to scroll back. Say I run a find command and the output spews out to more than 80 lines - the size of my terminal window. If I am running in screen mode - by default I can scroll back only upto 100 lines. And then, this post came to my rescue:<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><a href="http://www.samsarin.com/blog/2007/03/11/gnu-screen-working-with-the-scrollback-buffer/" target="_blank">screen scrollback solution</a><br /><br />Not only does it give a scroll back solution, it also showed a really cool trick - you can actually do a vi type '/' and '?' search on the output of your shell till now - now that's something.  Also while you are at it - do check out:<br /><br /><a href="http://brainscraps.wikidot.com/screen" target="_blank">Putty connection manager + screen post</a><br /><br />Let me hear you screen!.
