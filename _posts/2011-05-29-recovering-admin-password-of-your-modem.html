<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Model: BSNL Dataone ATE ZXDSL 531B modem. (Below points worth a shot for any other modem also)<br /><br /><b>Assumption</b>: You have saved your modem settings locally on your machine. If not, don't be disheartened (Do slap yourself thrice though), <a href="http://curiosityhealsthecat.blogspot.com/2011/06/easiest-way-to-recover-admin-password.html" target="_blank">this</a> post will help you out.<br /><br />If you don't know how to upload/save your modem/router's configuration file, read <a href="http://curiosityhealsthecat.blogspot.com/2011/05/securing-bsnl-zte-dsl-modem.html" target="_blank">this</a>.<br /><br />I had forgotten the admin password and I didn't want to reset my modem. Just wanted to see if I could get any info from the configuration that I backed up. <br /><br />I opened up the file and searched for the keyword "admin" and I came across this block:<br /><pre>&lt;sysusername value="admin"&gt;<br />&lt;syspassword value="YWRtaW5fcGFzc3dk"&gt;<br /></pre>Took a blind shot to see if it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" target="_blank">base64</a> encoding and &lt;insert your jumping-with-surprise word here&gt; it was base64 encoded!<br /><a name='more'></a><br />Running this through the following command line on Ubuntu:<br /><code><br />echo "YWRtaW5fcGFzc3dk" | openssl base64 -d<br /></code><br />results in:<br /><code><br />admin_passwd<br /></code><br />If you don't have your Linux box handy (I don't see any reason why you shouldn't) you can use any of the online base64 decoders to get the plain text. Here's <a href="http://www.opinionatedgeek.com/dotnet/tools/base64decode/" target="_blank">one</a>.</div>
