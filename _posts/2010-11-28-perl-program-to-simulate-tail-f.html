Created a github account to share my bin with the rest of the world.<br /><br />Had written a perl program to simulate tail -f quite some time ago. Put it up there. Enjoyed writing it. Hope you feel the same while playing with it.<br /><br />Here it is: <a href="https://github.com/saurabh-hirani/examples/blob/master/bin/perl/simtail.pl" target="new">simtail.pl</a>
