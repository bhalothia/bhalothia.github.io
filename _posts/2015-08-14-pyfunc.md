Python has a solid backbone of modules for aiding command line activities. It
would be a pity if we had to write one-liner python programs just because we
cannot avail those functionalities on the command line - wouldn't it?

**Day 1:**

I wanted to query a heavily nested json for a specific key.
Now [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) does the job pretty well, but the
easier way was to flatten the json and just grep out the required key. I had
a flatten json python function already written. So all I did was to write a
simple program to include that module and flatten the file fed on the command
line. Good enough.

**Day 2:**

I wanted to find out if one file is a subset of the other. I looked it up and
saw that [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16349543/how-to-determine-if-the-content-of-one-file-is-included-in-the-content-of-anothe)
post describes a way to do so:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cat b | sort -u | wc
$ cat a b | sort -u | wc
{% endhighlight %}

which is pretty neat but then I would need to compare the two results and write
a shell script todo so. The python library provides the set data structure having
the very intuitive **issubset** function which just does this. So all I did was 
to write a simple program to write a function to do so. Does the trick.

**Day 3:**

A colleague was mangling some text and asked me how to convert uppercase to
lowercase. I showed him how:


{% highlight bash %}
$ echo TEST | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'
{% endhighlight %}

He asked is there a similar functionality to swap case? I did not have a ready
answer to do so on the command line but told him that he could write a one
liner python script using **string.swapcase** to do so.

Now wait a minute...

Why would I want to write separate programs to flatten a json, check if a file
is a subset of the other or swap case when I could very written write one
program which takes the target module, function to call, its arguments and 
does the right thing.

Enter [pyfunc](https://github.com/saurabh-hirani/pyfunc)

Now all of the above problems are solved by doing:

{% highlight bash %}
$ pyfunc -m pyfunc.utils.json_flatten -a /var/tmp/test.json

$ echo TeSt | pyfunc -m string.swapcase
tEsT

$ pyfunc -m pyfunc.utils.f_is_subset -a /var/tmp/f1 /var/tmp/f2
True
{% endhighlight %}

I get everything in the standard library as a bonus:


{% highlight bash %}
$ pyfunc -m range 1 7 2
1
3
5
{% endhighlight %}

For the commonly used pyfunc calls I convert them to aliases:

{% highlight bash %}
$ alias jsonflatten='pyfunc -m pyfunc.utils.json_flatten -a'
$ alias fsubset='pyfunc -m pyfunc.utils.f_is_subset -a'
{% endhighlight %}

And now I have a richer command line:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cat /var/tmp/test.json | jsonflatten | grep 'mykey'
{% endhighlight %}

The only glitch that I faced while writing this was to accomodate different
types of arguments being passed to the target functions like list, dict, etc.
I added support for method signatures to do so, but now I feel it would be 
easier to have pyfunc functions to just take args and pass in a json from the
command line. Will be adding this support soon.

**pip** pyfunc up and bring the awesomeness of python on the command line!
