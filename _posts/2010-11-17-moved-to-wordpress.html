Wanted to play with wordpress for quite some time and also wanted to see how difficult/easy it is to migrate posts from blogspot to wordpress. <br /><br />Verdict: It don't get any simpler than this. Wordpress has an inbuilt import feature. All you need to do is to point it to the blogspot blog url and it asks whether you are allowing this or not. If you give it a nod, it does what's needed. Clean.<br /><br />Point and click - <a href="http://curiosityhealsthecat.wordpress.com/">Here</a>
