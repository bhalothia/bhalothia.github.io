Does your job require you to boot up your box in Windows instead of Ubuntu? Do you miss the vi-mode on the command line? Do you become nostalgic at the mention of multiple shell tab sessions? Do you feel like <b>bash</b>ing your boss's head if he says he won't <b>shell</b> out any extra money to buy you a shiny new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/download.mspx">Windows power shell</a> (I think it should be worth a try)<br /><br />Fear not, for the open source world has made efforts to bring you closer to your $HOME.<br />&nbsp; <br /><b>Cygwin</b> - a Linux like environment for Windows gives you all the tools that you missed on cmd.exe - find, grep, ls and many more. You can download Cygwin from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin home</a><br /><br />Just remember one thing - when you install it for the first time - do a basic installation - i.e. do not select too many packages. Let the default installation do its job. You can always add new packages by running the setup again (<b>no</b> - it won't erase the previous setup - that's just cygwin's way of adding new packages).<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>And while I see some of you drooling and foaming at the mouth with this knowledge, while others rubbing their palms in anticipation and clearing your throats for a wicked mad scientist laugh, a little info which saved me some more time while installing cygwin - the <b>clear</b> command is a part of the <b>ncurses</b> package, which is not a part of the default installation. So check that one on if you can type clear faster than you can do a ctrl-l.<br /><br />And so with <b>cygwin</b>, it is a cyg-win-win situation. I will try to keep the wordplay at a minimum - I promise. Please read on.<br /><br />Cygwin gives you <b>find</b> but not the vi-mode on the shell. And neither does it give you tabbing. <br /><br />That prophecy is fulfilled by&nbsp;<a href="http://en.poderosa.org/">Poderosa</a>. Its pre-requisite is the presence of Cygwin (I don't think it does check but it has a cygwin icon on which you click to open up tabbed cygwin sessions). Download it. Its a simple 'click-next-click' installation.<br /><br />But whenever I try to connect to cygwin via Poderosa I get an error "<b>The registry key SOFTWARE\Cygnus Solutions\Cygwin\mounts v2\/ is not found. Cygwin may not be installed correctly</b>" (Damn you windows for not giving copy-paste on error dialog boxes. ). But like a good ignorant Windows user I click OK and it works.<br /><br />&lt;jingle_bells_tone&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; multi tabs, multi tabs - bashing all the way.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; oh what fun, it is to type, in the vi-mode today.&nbsp; <br />&lt;/jingle_bells_tone&gt;<br /><br />I have been using Cygwin + Podersoa as per the recommended dosage and the doctor says my recovery is pretty fast.<br /><br />Get well soon..
