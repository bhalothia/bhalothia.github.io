<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Dear blogspot,<br /><br />We need to talk. I have been meaning to tell you this for quite some time. Everytime I typed in this WYSIWYG word editor and accidentally did an esc+j followed by a Homer Simpson "doh" reminding me that it isn't vim, my heart shed a tear. I tried using addons, plugins but you didn't budge. I even did a one-night stand with wordpress - but she didn't even let me muck around with her plugins, the way you did - I'll give you that. But I had to wait an eternity to get code syntax highlighting enabled with you.<br /><br />Before you think that this is just my usual rant and I will soon be drafting another post through this rich-text-editor of yours, you are mistaken. I've... I've met someone. And she/he/it/they let me type in markdown. You can't hear me but I say this with a lump in my throat while I weep tears of joy. I get to type my posts in vim (don't cringe - you know I've loved vim right from the start). And I get to check them in via git.<br /><br />MARKDOWN!! VIM!! GIT CHECKINS!!! CAN YOU EVEN COMPREHEND THE EASE OF USE??<br /><br />I am leaving you. I can't stand this white box peppered with small-t-big-T, font-size, bold, italics buttons anymore. I am moving on.<br /><br />I am going to github pages. Now, now, don't play that single-sign-on card with me. git global credential cache is good enough for everyone.<br /><br />As far as the custody of our existing posts go - I think it would be better for both of us if I slowly migrate each of them to their new home. You can come over whenever you want. Which I know you never will. <br /><br />This is where I live now - <a href="http://saurabh-hirani.github.io/writing/">http://saurabh-hirani.github.io/writing/</a><br /><br />This is what I am leaving you for - a repo of my works -&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/saurabh-hirani/saurabh-hirani.github.io/">https://github.com/saurabh-hirani/saurabh-hirani.github.io/</a><br /><br />We had a good run. We really did. But I don't belong here.<br /><br />So long and thanks for everything.<br /><br />--<br />Saurabh<br /><br />P.S: I will still host <a href="http://crashpoint-zeros-brain.blogspot.in/">http://crashpoint-zeros-brain.blogspot.in/</a> on you - take care of that for me. <br /><br /></div>
